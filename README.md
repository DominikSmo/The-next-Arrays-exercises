# Merging four arrays with different lengths each(another solution)

In the fourth repository I presented a solution of merging four arrays with different lengths starting from filling of the shortest array. 

I used a method with subtraction from concrete numbers numeric values of each index of each array.
In this exercise I would like to showcase a method of filling arrays by using sums of the values of the next indices with concrete numbers.
